# Teal Debugger Tutorial

## Pre-requisites
Make sure you have `go-algorand` checked out and ran `make install`. You should be able to run `tealdbg` from your terminal. This tutorial also uses `sandbox`, so make sure you have that as well. 

## Introduction
This tutorial walks through some steps on using `tealdbg` using the Chrome Developer Tools (CDT). We will use `sandbox` and the Python SDK instead of `goal` to execute some commands for simplicity's sake (imo).
