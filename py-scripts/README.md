# Python Scripts

This directory contains some Python scripts that interact with the Python SDK
and/or Sandbox.

## Examples
* `compile_teal.py`: Uses the Python SDK to compile a TEAL program
* `dryrun_debug.py`: Uses the Python SDK and Sandbox to debug a TEAL program
using a dryrun remote endpoint. Make sure you change the path to your sandbox.
